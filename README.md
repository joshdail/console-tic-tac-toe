# Console tic tac toe
A simple console tic-tac-toe game, written in Python

The main.py file handles starting and resetting the game. Once the game begins, the game manager takes it from there.

In this first version, the computer AI is very basic. It selects one row/column/diagonal as a "strategy" to select moves from. If the player moves to a space in the currently selected "strategy," the computer will select a new strategy. The current AI does not anticpate or block player moves.
